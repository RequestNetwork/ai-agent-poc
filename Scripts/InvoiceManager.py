    This function prepares the necessary and mandatory parameters required to generate an invoice.

    Parameters
    ----------
    clientInfo : dict
        Dictionary containing the client's information, including the email address and the identity address.
        Example: {"email": "client@example.com"}
    currency : str
        The currency of the invoice. Can be 'ETH-sepolia' or a custom currency.

    price : float
        The amount in the specified currency required to deliver the service.
    serviceName : str, optional
        A short description of the service being invoiced. If not provided, defaults to 'AI Haiku Service'.
    
    Returns
    -------
    dict
        A dictionary (`invoice_payload`) containing all the necessary fields for invoice creation, 
        ready to be sent to the Request Network API.

    Notes
    -----
    - The `price` is converted into Wei (1 ETH = 10^18 Wei).
    - The function generates a unique invoice number using UUID.
    - The default currency is 'ETH-sepolia', and the service name defaults to 'AI Haiku Service' if none is provided.
    - The buyer's email is taken from the `clientInfo` dictionary, while other details (such as the address) are commented out for potential customization.
    - The payment address is predefined and set in the `paymentReceiverAddress` variable.

    Example
    -------

        clientInfo={"email": "client@example.com"},

    GenerateAndSendInvoice
    ----------------------
    Main function to generate and send an invoice using the Request Network API. 
    It creates the payload, sends the invoice, and returns either a payment reference for automated payment

    Parameters
    ----------
    clientInfo_Email : str
        The email address of the client to whom the invoice will be sent.
    clientInfo_identity_address : str
        The buyer identity  / wallet address
    currency : str
        The currency in which the invoice is issued (e.g., 'ETH-sepolia'). Currently, only 'ETH-sepolia' is supported (in wei).
    price : float
        The amount of the invoice, in the specified currency, required for the service.
    serviceName : str or None
        A brief description of the service. If None, a default service name is used.
    autoPayment : bool
        If True, the function will generate and return a payment reference for automated payment by AI.
        If False, it will return a URL for manual payment.

    Returns
    -------
    str
        A message detailing either the payment reference for automated payment or a URL for manual payment.
        The message also includes the invoice ID, which can be used to track the status of the payment.

    Notes
    -----
    - If any mandatory information (email, currency, or price) is missing, the function returns an error message.
    - The function first generates the invoice payload using `GeneratePayload`, then sends the invoice using `Send_invoice`.
    - If `autoPayment` is True, a payment reference is generated using `computePaymentReference` and returned.
    - If `autoPayment` is False, a manual payment URL is returned.
